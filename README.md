# Simple-Direct-Mapped-Cache-Simulation-in-C

This C program simulates a simple direct-mapped cache with a fixed cache size and block size. The main features of the program include initializing the cache, processing memory access requests, and displaying cache content and statistics. The user can input memory addresses to simulate cache accesses, and the program will track and display the number of hits, misses, and evictions. This simulation helps in understanding basic cache operations such as hit/miss detection and cache eviction in a direct-mapped cache setup.
